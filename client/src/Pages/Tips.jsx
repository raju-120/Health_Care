                            regular sleep pattern through these measures:Try to go to bed and get up at 
                            the same time each day,Understand your sleep need, including both the timing 
                            of sleep and the duration of sleep.Try and spend some time outdoors or in 
                            natural light during the daytime, as this provides an important cue to your 
                            brain the timing of the body clock.
