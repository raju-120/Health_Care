The most common areas where abscess can develop are the armpits, around the anus and vagina, the base of the spine, around a tooth and the groin area. It is painful and should be treated by a doctor.",
      "one": "Abscesses are caused by obstruction of sweat glands, swelling of hair follicles, or minor breaks and deflate the skin. Germs get beneath the skin or into these glands, which causes a stirring response as the body’s resistance try to exterminate these germs.",
      "two": "The middle of the abscess dissolves and contains dead cells, bacteria, and other debris. This region begins to grow, creating pressure beneath the skin and further swelling of the adjoining tissues. Pressure and swelling cause the pain.",

      "footer": "The doctor will first take the medical history and may ask the person about how long the abscess has been there, any previous injury to the area affected by an abscess, medication, any allergies, etc.The doctor will then examine the area affected with an abscess. If it is near the anus, he will perform a rectal exam. If it is growing under the arm or leg, then he will feel the lymph gland under the arm or groin area."

      "name": "Acute Heart Attack",
      "description" : "“Heart Attack“, technically termed Myocardial Infarction, is a result of total blockage of the blood vessel (coronary artery) which supplies blood to the heart. The blockage is due to the formation of plug composed of cholesterol, blood cells, fibrin and calcium.Major risk factors are those that research has shown significantly increase the risk of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. Other factors are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but their significance and prevalence have not yet been precisely determined. They are called contributing risk factors.The American Heart Association has identified several risk factors. Some of them can be modified, treated or controlled, and some can’t. The more risk factors you have, the greater your chance of developing coronary heart disease. Also, the greater the lever of each risk factor, the greater the risk. For example, a person with a total cholesterol of 300 mg/dL has a greater risk than someone with a total cholesterol of 245 mg/dL, even though everyone with a total cholesterol greater than 240 mg/dL is considered high-risk.",
      "one": "Over 83 percent of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65 or older. At older ages, women who have heart attacks are more likely than men are, to die from them within a few weeks",
      "two": "Men have a greater risk of heart attack than women do, and they have attacks earlier in life. Heredity (including Race): Children of parents with heart disease are more likely to develop it themselves. Just as you cant control your age, sex and race, you cant control your family history. Therefore, it’s even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.",
      "three": "Smokers risk of developing coronary heart disease is 24 times that of nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking is a powerful independent risk factor for sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary heart disease. Exposure to other peoples smoke increases the risk of heart disease ever for nonsmokers.People who stop smoking at 60 years gain 3 years extra life, at 50 years-6 years, at 40 years – 9 years and at 30 years – 10 years. Smoking also totally cancels the actions of Aspirin, a cardiovascular protecting drug and cancels 75% of the actions of Statins.",
      "four": "High blood pressure increases the heart’s workload, causing the heart to thicken and become stiffer. It also increases your risk of stroke, heart attack, kidney failure and congestive heart failure. When high blood pressure exists with obesity, smoking, high blood cholesterol levels or diabetes, the risk of heart attack or stroke increases several times.",
      "five": "Individual response to stress may be a contributing factor. Some scientists have noted a relationship between coronary heart disease risk and stress in a person’s life, their health behaviors and socioeconomic status. These factors may also affect established risk factors. For example, people under stress may overeat, start smoking or smoke more than they otherwise would. Alcohol: Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure, cause heart failure and lead to stroke. It can contribute to high triglycerides, cancer and other diseases, and produce irregular heartbeats. It also contributes to obesity, alcoholism, suicide and accidents.",
      "six": " The important aim of early institution of treatment is to save the heart muscle from damage following lack of blood supply. Blood thinning medications, drugs that improve demand-supply imbalance (beta blockers), drugs that reduce blood cholesterol (statins) and drugs that improve the remodeling of the heart after the attack (ACE inhibitors) form the mainstay of management of heart attacks.",
      "footer": "When many lakhs of cars are moving on the roads only a few cars meet with accidents. Cars with defective brakes, gears or non-aligned tyres have increased chances of accidents. Likewise, extensive clinical and statistical studies have identified several factors that increase the risk of coronary heart disease and heart attack."

Benign tumors are less harmful as compared to malignant ones, but a benign tumor can cause problems in the brain by pressing on a nearby tissue.Brain tumors that originate in brain cells are called primary brain tumors. The most common primary brain tumors are gliomas, menin-giomas, pituitary adenomas, vestibular schwannomas, and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (medulloblastomas).

The most widely used treatments are surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Many people with brain tumors undergo surgery or a stereotactic brain surgery in which the tumor is removed with the assistance of image guidance, leaving the healthy brain relatively intact. Neuroendoscopy is another minimally-invasive surgical procedure where the tumor is removed through small holes in the skull, mouth or nose, enabling neurosurgeons to access areas of the brain that cannot be reached with traditional surgery."
